[[Cognitive Dissonance]] occurs when a conflict arises between your [[Imagination & Feeling]]
<br>
[[The mind]] may logically be thinking about one thing, all the while feeling something else to be right
<br>
Metaphorically, it is a "head vs heart" situation

A reconciliation is required to resolve the issue, and reach equanimity again
