Through repetition of certain patterns, the mind gets comfortably attached to certain things when they repeatedly occur in the environment

Also certain intense traumatic experiences imbue [[the mind]] with immense [[conditioning]] & [[pain]]

These attachments can either be in the form of wanting something or avoiding something

This is essential for survival...
<br>
But [[the mind]] has the tendency to attach emotional values to everything it encounters

An identity emerges from it... [[the ego]]

This is an imaginary identity which consists of both [[positive]] & [[negative]] emotional charges

This identity consists of both [[truth]] and [[falseness]]

Which grows, evolves, morphs & gets purified with time...
<br>
[[The ego]] is also what creates the [[personality]] of a person

This innate personality isn't the truest identity of a person, but it is the deepest form [[the ego]] takes

It has been formed through conditionings & learnings (which meant most to us and) we pick up from our environment
