This is how your mind was when you were born...

Before all the false [[conditioning]] took place

Before all the mental & physical trauma took place

This is the healthiest state of [[the mind]]

A mind which cannot be easily disturbed by [[mental suffering]]

I do not know if it is possible to sustain this state permanently (which some may call "[[enlightenment]]"), but working towards it and having glimpses of it is an absolute possibility for anyone!
