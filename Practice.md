There are many modes of practice...

And each & every one of them are suited to a certain type of individual

Here, I will list the essential practices one can do to achieve a harmonious or [[healthy mind]]:

1. [[Physical exercises]] (to feel our bodies deeper)
2. [[Breathing exercises]] (to regulate feelings & release unwanted emotions)
3. [[Journaling]] (to express & release unwanted thoughts)
4. [[Observation]] of [[the mind]] (to gain clarity and wisdom into how the mind functions)

The goal is to become conscious of the unconscious, and deal with those uncomfortable imaginations & feelings which arise and also enjoy the pleasant ones (without any judgement) by becoming more aware of our body, breath & mind.
