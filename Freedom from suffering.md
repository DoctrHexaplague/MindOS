It is possible to free [[the mind]] from this [[mental suffering]]

Although the journey may be difficult...

This is due to [[the mind]]'s tendency to latch onto [[conditioning]]
<br>
Also because [[the ego]] aspect of [[the mind]] doesn't want to be seen for its [[deception]]

It creates a huge amount of [[pain]] & [[confusion]] both mentally & physically
<br>
One must endure a lot of suffering (depending upon the magnitude of their false conditioning) to attain a perfectly [[healthy mind]]

It can be done through [[practice]]...
